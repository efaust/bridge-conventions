Opening Bids
------------

We open all 11 counts; and many good 10s, frequently upgrading on shape.

Preempting style is very light in 3rd seat; sound in 1st/2nd red and light 1st/2nd white.

.. _Responding to 1C:

------------------------------------------
Responding to a 1\ :club-suit:`C` opening:
------------------------------------------

The first priority of responder is to let opener know if we are in a game
force or not.

*If responder is a passed hand*:

.. _Responding to 1D:

---------------------------------------------
Responding to a 1\ :diamond-suit:`D` opening:
---------------------------------------------

Generally, we treat opener's hand as 11-13 balanced unless otherwise told.

Important note: Reverses are alertable, and *non-forcing*, showing only 
extreme shape. Care should be taken when reversing if responder has a
potentially weak hand.

--------------------
General notes on 1M:
--------------------

Opener's hand is limited, so our raise structure is a bit different from 
normal 2/1 systems.

Important note: Reverses are alertable, and *non-forcing*, showing only 
extreme shape. Care should be taken when reversing if responder has a
potentially weak  hand (especially after forcing 1NT).

In competition (except after double), 3M is strictly weak, and 
we re-purpose the bid immediately before as a mixed raise.

In addition, new suits at the two level are negative.

(**EVENTUALLY**) After a double, we play a basic transfer system:

.. _Responding to 1NT:

----------------------------
Responding to a 1NT opening:
----------------------------

14-16 HCP; Balanced. 

Frequently has a 5 card major, 6 card minor, often contains singleton honor, or two doubletons.

.. _Responding to 2C:

------------------------------------------
Responding to a 2\ :club-suit:`C` opening:
------------------------------------------

Things are fairly artificial here; due to the lack of space. Often times;
responder will raise \ :club-suit:`C` preemptively instead of showing a 5-card major 
with a sub-invite hand.
