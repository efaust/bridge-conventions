Opening Bids
------------

We open all 11 counts; and many good 10s, frequently upgrading on shape.

Preempting style is very light in 3rd seat; sound in 1st/2nd red and light 1st/2nd white.

General notes on 1M:
--------------------

Opener's hand is limited, so our raise structure is a bit different from 
normal 2/1 systems.

Important note: Reverses are alertable, and *non-forcing*, showing only 
extreme shape. Care should be taken when reversing if responder has a
potentially weak  hand (especially after forcing 1NT).

In competition (except after double), 3M is strictly weak, and 
we re-purpose the bid immediately before as a mixed raise.

In addition, new suits at the two level are negative.

(**EVENTUALLY**) After a double, we play a basic transfer system:

Responding to a 1NT opening:

14-16 HCP; Balanced.

.. _Responding to 2C:

------------------------------------------
Responding to a 2\ :club-suit:`C` opening:
------------------------------------------

Things are fairly artificial here; due to the lack of space. Often times;
responder will raise \ :club-suit:`C` preemptively instead of showing a 5-card major 
with a sub-invite hand.
