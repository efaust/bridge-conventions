      We open all 11 counts; and many good 10s, frequently upgrading on shape.

      Preempting style is very light in 3rd seat; sound in 1st/2nd red and light 1st/2nd white.

      The first priority of responder is to let opener know if we are in a game
      force or not.

    title: "General notes on 1M:"
    contents: | 
      Opener's hand is limited, so our raise structure is a bit different from 
      normal 2/1 systems.

      Important note: Reverses are alertable, and *non-forcing*, showing only 
      extreme shape. Care should be taken when reversing if responder has a
      potentially weak  hand (especially after forcing 1NT).
      
      In competition (except after double), 3M is strictly weak, and 
      we re-purpose the bid immediately before as a mixed raise.

      In addition, new suits at the two level are negative.
      
      (**EVENTUALLY**) After a double, we play a basic transfer system:

      14-16 HCP; Balanced. 
      
      Frequently has a 5 card major, 6 card minor, often contains singleton honor, or two doubletons.

    title: "Responding to a 2!C opening:"
    anchor: Responding to 2C
    contents: |
      Things are fairly artificial here; due to the lack of space. Often times;
      responder will raise !C preemptively instead of showing a 5-card major 
      with a sub-invite hand.
